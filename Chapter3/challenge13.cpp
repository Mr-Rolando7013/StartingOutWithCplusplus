/*A country collects property taces on the assessment value of property,
which is 60 percent of the property's actual value. If an acre of land is valued
at $10,000, it's assessment value is $6000. The property tax is then 64c for each $100
of the assesment value. The tax for the acre assessed at $6000 will be $38.40.
Write a program that asks for the actual value of a piece of property and displays
the assessment value and property tax.*/
