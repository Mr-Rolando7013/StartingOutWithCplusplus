/*A retail company must file a monthly sales tax report listing the sales
for the month and the amount of sales tax collected. Write a program that asks
for the month, the year, and the total amount collected at the cash register
(that is, sales plus sales tax). Assume the state sales tax is 4 percent and the
county sales tax is 2 percent.

If the total amount collected is known and the total sales tax is 6 percent, the
amount of product sales may be calculated as:
s = (T/1.06)

s is the product sales and T is the total income (product sales plus sales tax).
The program should display a report similar to
Month: October
