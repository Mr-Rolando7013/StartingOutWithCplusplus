/*
Modify the program of challenge 18 so that it reports the number of pizzas you need to buy
for a party if each person attending is expected to eat an average of 4 slices. The program
should ask the user for the number of people who will be at the party and for the diameter 
of the pizzas to be ordered. It should then calcualte and display the number of pizzas to purchase.
